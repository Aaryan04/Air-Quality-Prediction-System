# Air-Quality-Prediction-System

This project was built while interning at Gustovalley Technovations LLP as a Machine Learning intern.

This project involved numerous steps before obtaining a final prediction system. Following steps were implemented- 

Step 1: Data Collection: Collected the real-time data using Air Quality API.

Step 2: Understanding the Data: The obtained dataset had 435742 rows with 13 coloumns. <br> <i>[Link to the dataset is provided in the description section of the repository (on the right side of the your screen)] </i> 

Step 3: Data Visualization: Implemented various visualization techniques
1. Pairplot
2. Histogram
3. Bar Plot(grouped and coloured)

Step 4: Checking the Null values and treated by cleaning them.

Step 5: Creating individual calculation functions.

Step 6: Creating a function to calculate the AQI of every data.

Step 7: Splitting the data into Dependent and Independent columns for model training.

Step 8: Implementing various algorithms such as: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours.

Step 9: Coming to the final conclusion and working for the trained model.
